    "Image analysis is an important part of materials science. Microstructures, or morphologies are often imaged using microscopes and often we are interested in quantifying, that is, measuring different features. These could be pore areas, cell sizes, fibre lengths, grain sizes, crack widths etc. In some cases we might be interested in analysing the image of a spectrum or a diffraction pattern for example. Here is a gratuitously pretty image of the microstruture of a 3D printed aerospace titanium alloy:\n",

    "Since it is now easy to digitise images, it is easy to exploit the power of computers to process and analyse them. Digital image processing is a big subject and there are many [multi-volume books](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781848001909) dedicated to image processing techniques. For general image processing, it's often easier to use a dedicated image processing program like the excellent [imageJ](http://imagej.net/Welcome), for example. \n",
